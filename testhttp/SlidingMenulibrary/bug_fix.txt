If I use the SlidingMenu together with ActionBarSherlock (maybe unrelated) and with this settings:

SlidingMenu sm = getSlidingMenu();
sm.setShadowWidthRes(R.dimen.shadow_width);
sm.setShadowDrawable(R.drawable.shadow);
sm.setBehindOffsetRes(R.dimen.slidingmenu_offset);
sm.setFadeDegree(0.35f);
sm.setTouchModeAbove(SlidingMenu.TOUCHMODE_FULLSCREEN);
sm.setTouchModeBehind(SlidingMenu.TOUCHMODE_FULLSCREEN);
I cannot use the view behind which has the effect that I cannot react on onListItemClick(...) in my ListFragment after days of research I found out that there is a bug in the CustomViewAbove.

My primary fix is to change a break in onInterceptTouchEvent() to return mQuickReturn;. So the ACTION_DOWN event code will look like this:

case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
    int index = MotionEventCompat.getActionIndex(ev);
    mActivePointerId = MotionEventCompat.getPointerId(ev, index);
    if (mActivePointerId == INVALID_POINTER)
        break;
    mLastMotionX = mInitialMotionX = MotionEventCompat.getX(ev, index);
    mLastMotionY = MotionEventCompat.getY(ev, index);
    if (thisTouchAllowed(ev)) {
        mIsBeingDragged = false;
        mIsUnableToDrag = false;
        if (isMenuOpen() && mViewBehind.menuTouchInQuickReturn(mContent, mCurItem, ev.getX() + mScrollX)) {
            mQuickReturn = true;
        }
    } else {
        mIsUnableToDrag = true;
    }
    return mQuickReturn;
Update: And also the onTouchEvent you need to change the case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN. There you need to replace the break with another return mQuickReturn. The case will look like that:

case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:
    /*
     * If being flinged and user touches, stop the fling. isFinished
     * will be false if being flinged.
     */
    completeScroll();

    // Remember where the motion event started
    int index = MotionEventCompat.getActionIndex(ev);
    mActivePointerId = MotionEventCompat.getPointerId(ev, index);
    mLastMotionX = mInitialMotionX = ev.getX();
    return mQuickReturn;
</update>

I also removed the setInternalPageChangeListener in initCustomViewAbove(). (The reason comes later.)

In the CustomViewBehind I changed the code of the functions onInterceptTouchEvent and onTouchEvent to use the code from the CustomViewAbove:

@Override
public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent e) {
    return mViewAbove.onInterceptTouchEvent(e);
}

@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent e) {
    return mViewAbove.onTouchEvent(e);
}
Now the part with the ChildrenEnabled is not anymore used and the function setChildrenEnabled and the member mChildrenEnabled can be removed.

Hopfully this will help others. By the way I would like to make a PushRequest but I don't know how to make that.
